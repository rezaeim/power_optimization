# Renewable Energy Integration Model

This code implements an optimization model for integrating wind and solar energy with storage facilities to meet a fluctuating demand profile. The goal is to minimize the overall cost, considering various factors such as energy generation costs, storage costs, and system constraints.

## Problem Description

The problem involves the following parameters and constraints:

- Demand: A list of demand values for different time periods.
- Maximum Wind and Solar Energy: Limits on the amount of energy that can be generated from wind and solar sources, respectively.
- Storage Capacity: The maximum amount of energy that can be stored in the storage facility.
- Storage Cost Factor: A factor that determines the cost of storing energy.
- Storage Degradation Factor: A factor representing the degradation of stored energy over time.
- Storage Efficiency: The efficiency of the energy storage process.
- Wind and Solar Costs: Costs associated with generating energy from wind and solar sources, respectively.
- Day-Night Indicator: A binary variable indicating whether it is day or night for each time period.

The model also includes various constraints, such as energy balance, storage capacity limits, and efficiency losses.

## How to Use

1. **Dependencies**:

   - Ensure you have Julia installed with the required packages (`JuMP`, `GLPK`, `Random`). You can install them using the following commands:

   ```
   using Pkg
   Pkg.add("JuMP")
   Pkg.add("GLPK")
   Pkg.add("Random")
   ```

2. **Running the Model**:

   - The main code file is named `renewable_energy_integration.jl`. You can run this file using Julia.

3. **Interpreting Results**:

   - After optimization, the model prints the objective value, which represents the total cost.
   - It then provides detailed information about energy generation and storage for each time period, along with the corresponding costs.

4. **Customization**:

   - You can customize parameters such as demand values, energy limits, costs, and storage-related factors to suit your specific scenario.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use this model:

```julia
include("renewable_energy_integration.jl")

# (Customize parameters if needed)

# Run the model and observe the results
```
